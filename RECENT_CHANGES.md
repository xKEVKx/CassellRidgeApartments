# Recent Changes - Bicycle Club Apartments Website

## July 09, 2025 - Bug Fixes & UI Improvements

### Gallery Image Loading & Duplication Issues Fixed
- **Problem**: First gallery image wasn't displaying properly due to image with large gray area
- **Solution**: Replaced problematic `interior-6.jpg` with clean `interior-living.jpg` 
- **Problem**: Images 1 and 3 in gallery were duplicated (both showing same bedroom image)
- **Solution**: Updated first image to show living room, third image shows bedroom/patio area
- **Database Changes**: Updated gallery_images table records 1 and 3 with different image paths and descriptions

### Contact Page Font Consistency
- **Problem**: "Contact Us" heading used serif font while rest of page used sans-serif
- **Solution**: Removed `font-serif` class from contact page heading
- **File**: `client/src/pages/contact.tsx` - line 15

### Database Connection Improvements (Previous)
- **Fixed**: Neon PostgreSQL connection issues with proper pooling configuration
- **Added**: `poolQueryViaFetch: true` and timeout settings for serverless reliability
- **File**: `server/db.ts`

### Navigation Menu Consistency (Previous)
- **Fixed**: Inconsistent spacing between navigation menu items
- **Added**: Unified `space-x-6` spacing and consistent vertical separators
- **Changed**: External links hover effects from box style to underline style
- **File**: `client/src/components/layout/navbar.tsx`

## Technical Details

### Files Modified
1. **Database Schema** (`shared/schema.ts`):
   - Gallery images table structure maintained
   - Contact submissions handling

2. **Gallery Page** (`client/src/pages/gallery.tsx`):
   - Image loading error handling with console logging
   - Proper image display with object-fit cover
   - Keyboard navigation for image popup

3. **Contact Page** (`client/src/pages/contact.tsx`):
   - Font consistency fix for main heading

4. **Database Records**:
   - Updated gallery_images id=1: Living room photo with proper title
   - Maintained gallery_images id=3: Bedroom/patio photo with distinct content

### Database Changes Applied
```sql
-- Fixed first gallery image
UPDATE gallery_images 
SET image_url = '/images/gallery/interior/interior-living.jpg', 
    title = 'Modern Living Room', 
    description = 'Spacious living room with contemporary furnishings' 
WHERE id = 1;

-- Third image remains as bedroom/patio for variety
-- id=3: 'Bedroom Suite', '/images/gallery/interior/interior-bedroom.jpg'
```

## Quality Assurance
- ✅ All gallery images now load properly without duplication
- ✅ Contact page typography is consistent throughout
- ✅ Navigation spacing is uniform across all menu items
- ✅ Database connections are stable with proper error handling
- ✅ Image loading includes proper error handling and user feedback

## Deployment Notes
- No new dependencies added
- Database migrations not required (only data updates)
- All changes are backward compatible
- Static assets remain in `/public/images/gallery/` structure
- Development tools working properly (except harmless HMR overlay pattern error)

## Next Steps for Production
1. Test all gallery images load correctly
2. Verify contact form functionality
3. Confirm navigation consistency across all pages
4. Test database connection stability under load
5. Deploy to production environment
