## Latest Updates (July 10, 2025)

### 🛠️ Admin Photo Gallery Management Improvements
**Status: COMPLETED ✅**

#### Issue Resolved
- Admin interface could crash when trying to update images that were deleted
- Deleted images left orphaned pending updates in component state
- Batch updates could fail when including non-existent image IDs

#### Solution Implemented
- **Validation Filter**: Added image existence check before processing updates
- **Automatic Cleanup**: Removes pending updates for deleted images from state
- **Error Prevention**: Validates current image IDs against pending updates
- **State Consistency**: Maintains clean update tracking after deletions

#### Technical Implementation
```javascript
// Filter out updates for images that don't exist anymore
const currentImageIds = new Set(images?.map(img => img.id) || []);
const validUpdates = Object.entries(updates).filter(([id]) => 
  currentImageIds.has(parseInt(id))
);

// Clean up any pending updates for deleted images
setPhotoUpdates(prev => {
  const updated = { ...prev };
  delete updated[deletedId];
  return updated;
});
```

#### Benefits
- No more crashes when updating non-existent images
- Cleaner admin interface state management
- Better error handling in photo management workflow
- Enhanced user experience with robust operations
