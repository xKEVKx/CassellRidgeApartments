## July 11, 2025 - Gallery Photo Consolidation & Loading Fix

### Problem Solved
- Gallery photos were not loading on the Gallery page
- Database references pointed to non-existent subdirectories and files
- Multiple duplicate image references causing confusion
- Inconsistent file naming and path structure

### Changes Made
1. **Photo Storage Consolidation**
   - Consolidated all gallery images to single `/public/images/gallery/` directory
   - Removed subdirectory structure (interior/, community/, amenities/)
   - Standardized file naming to `bicycleclub-XX.jpg` format

2. **Database Path Updates**
   - Updated all 34 gallery image references in database
   - Changed paths from `/images/gallery/interior/bicycleclub-interior-X.jpg` to `/images/gallery/bicycleclub-XX.jpg`
   - Fixed file extension mismatch for bicycleclub-35.png

3. **Broken Reference Cleanup**
   - Removed 3 database entries for non-existent files (bicycleclub-36.jpg, 37.jpg, 38.jpg)
   - Eliminated duplicate image references by assigning unique files
   - Verified all 31 remaining gallery images load correctly

4. **Technical Implementation**
   - Database migration to update `gallery_images` table
   - File mapping from database IDs to sequential numbered files
   - HTTP status verification for all image URLs
   - Cleanup of orphaned database records

### Result
- All gallery photos now load correctly on the Gallery page
- Database contains 31 valid gallery images with proper file references
- Photo storage is consolidated and efficiently organized
- No broken image links or duplicate references remain

### Files Modified
- Database: `gallery_images` table - updated image_url column for all records
- File System: Consolidated photos to `/public/images/gallery/` directory
- No code changes required - issue was data/storage related

### Testing Performed
- Verified all 31 gallery images load with HTTP 200 status
- Confirmed no duplicate image references in database
- Tested Gallery page functionality with all photo categories
- Validated image URLs return proper JPEG/PNG content types
