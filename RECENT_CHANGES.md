## Gallery Directory Consolidation & Image Management

### Summary
Consolidated all gallery images into a single organized directory structure, removed duplicate files, and optimized storage while maintaining authentic Bicycle Club content.

### Technical Changes

#### Directory Structure Changes
- **Before**: Images scattered across multiple directories (`/amenities/authentic/`, `/gallery/authentic/`, `/gallery/`, `/amenities/`)
- **After**: Consolidated into single organized structure:
  ```
  public/images/gallery/
  ├── interior/     (13 images)
  ├── exterior/     (7 images)
  ├── pool/         (12 images)
  ├── amenities/    (3 images)
  └── community/    (2 images)
  ```

#### Database Changes
- Updated all 37 image paths in `gallery_images` table to reflect new structure
- Standardized path format: `/images/gallery/{category}/{filename}.jpg`
- Maintained proper categorization for filtering functionality

#### File Operations
- Moved all gallery images to organized subdirectories
- Removed 60+ duplicate image files using MD5 verification
- Reduced total image files from 104 to 44 (57% reduction)
- Cleaned up empty directories

#### Database Recovery
- Resolved database connection issues (XX000 error)
- Recreated PostgreSQL database with proper schema
- Restored all authentic Bicycle Club data:
  - 4 floor plans (Aspen, Vail, Montrose, Vista)
  - 37 gallery images across 5 categories
  - Proper categorization and metadata

### Files Modified
